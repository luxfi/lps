This LP defines how unique, non-fungible tokens are created and managed. LRC-721 will include the familiar interfaces: ownerOf(tokenId), transferFrom (or safeTransfer), approve/setApprovalForAll, and events like Transfer and Approval targeting individual token IDs.

## Motivation

A common NFT interface ensures wallets, marketplaces, and tools interoperate seamlessly, enabling portability of digital assets across Lux dApps and infrastructure.

## Copyright

Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](../LICENSE.md).
## Specification

Normative content includes the processes, data formats, and constants described in this LP; implementations MUST conform for compatibility.

## Rationale

The approach balances practicality with future‑proofing within the Lux ecosystem.

## Backwards Compatibility

Additive change with no breaking effects; rollout is optional and incremental.

## Security Considerations

Consider attack surfaces discussed herein; validate inputs and use safe primitives and rate‑limits where applicable.
