## Abstract

This LP serves as an index and overview of all developer-focused tools, frameworks, and infrastructure specifications in the Lux Network ecosystem. It provides developers with a comprehensive guide to available tooling and their respective specifications.

## Motivation

As the Lux ecosystem grows, developers need a centralized reference point to discover and understand the various tools available for building on Lux. This LP consolidates all developer-related specifications into a single, easily navigable document.

## Developer Tool Categories

### 1. Testing and Development Infrastructure

#### [LP-6: Network Runner & Testing Framework](./lp-6.md)
- **Status**: Draft
- **Purpose**: Provides a standardized framework for running local Lux networks for development and testing
- **Key Features**:
  - Local network simulation
  - Automated testing infrastructure
  - Multi-chain testing support
  - Performance benchmarking tools

### 2. Virtual Machine Development

#### [LP-7: VM SDK Specification](./lp-7.md)
- **Status**: Draft
- **Purpose**: Software Development Kit for creating custom Virtual Machines on Lux
- **Key Features**:
  - VM interface standardization
  - Language-agnostic VM development
  - State management abstractions
  - Consensus integration helpers

### 3. Plugin Architecture

#### [LP-8: Plugin Architecture](./lp-8.md)
- **Status**: Draft
- **Purpose**: Extensible plugin system for Lux nodes
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic plugin loading
  - API standardization
  - Security sandboxing
  - Resource management

### 4. Command Line Interface

#### [LP-9: CLI Tool Specification](./lp-9.md)
- **Status**: Draft
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive command-line interface for Lux operations
- **Key Features**:
  - Node management commands
  - Wallet operations
  - Network diagnostics
  - Development utilities

## Getting Started

### For New Developers

1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install the CLI tool ([LP-9](./lp-9.md))
   - Set up Network Runner ([LP-6](./lp-6.md))
   - Configure your development environment

2. **Choose Your Development Path**
   - **Building dApps**: Focus on existing chains (C-Chain, X-Chain)
   - **Creating Custom VMs**: Study the VM SDK ([LP-7](./lp-7.md))
   - **Extending Node Functionality**: Review Plugin Architecture ([LP-8](./lp-8.md))

3. **Testing Your Application**
   - Use Network Runner for local testing
   - Leverage the testing framework for automated tests
   - Deploy to testnet before mainnet

### For Tool Developers

If you're building developer tools for the Lux ecosystem:

1. Review existing tool specifications to avoid duplication
2. Ensure compatibility with established interfaces
3. Consider proposing new LPs for significant new tools
4. Integrate with existing infrastructure where possible

## Best Practices

### Tool Selection
- Use official Lux tools when available
- Prefer tools with "Final" status for production
- Check tool compatibility with your target Lux version

### Development Workflow
1. Local development with Network Runner
2. Unit testing with the testing framework
3. Integration testing on testnet
4. Performance testing before mainnet deployment

### Security Considerations
- Always use the latest tool versions
- Follow security guidelines in each tool's documentation
- Audit custom plugins and VMs before deployment
- Use secure key management practices

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements
- IDE integrations (VS Code, IntelliJ)
- Enhanced debugging tools
- Performance profiling suite
- Automated deployment pipelines

### Community Contributions
- Tool developers are encouraged to propose new LPs
- Improvements to existing tools should be discussed in respective LP discussions
- Security vulnerabilities should be reported through proper channels

## Related Specifications

### Core Infrastructure
- [LP-0: Lux Network Architecture](./lp-0.md)
- [LP-1: Lux Consensus](./lp-1.md)
- [LP-2: Lux Virtual Machine](./lp-2.md)

### Token Standards
- [LP-20: LRC-20 Token Standard](./lp-20.md)
- [LP-721: LRC-721 NFT Standard](./lp-721.md)

## Copyright

Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](../LICENSE.md).
## Specification

Normative definitions for data structures, processes, and parameters in this LP MUST be followed for compatibility across Lux components.

## Rationale

Chosen trade‑offs maximize maintainability and safety while delivering the intended functionality.

## Backwards Compatibility

Additive changes only; existing pathways continue to work. Migration is optional and incremental.

## Security Considerations

Apply common security controls, validate inputs, and ensure cryptographic operations are implemented with constant‑time and side‑channel‑safe practices where applicable.
