## Abstract

This proposal introduces the Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSS) implementation in Lux Network's threshold cryptography suite. LSS is a foundational threshold signature protocol that enables dynamic resharing - the ability to change the participant set and threshold without changing the public key. This capability is crucial for long-lived systems where validator sets change over time. 

**Enhancement over Original Paper**: While Vishnu's original LSS paper described a trusted dealer setup, our implementation enhances this with a fully distributed key generation (DKG) protocol, eliminating any single point of trust. This makes LSS suitable for trustless environments while maintaining all dynamic resharing capabilities.

LSS complements the CGG21 (CMP) protocol described in LP-14 by providing a simpler, more flexible approach to threshold signatures with unique dynamic properties not available in ECDSA-based schemes.

## Motivation and Rationale

While CGG21/CMP provides state-of-the-art threshold ECDSA with identifiable aborts, there are scenarios where a simpler, more flexible approach is beneficial:

1. **Dynamic Participant Sets**: LSS uniquely supports changing the set of participants (adding/removing parties) while maintaining the same public key
2. **Threshold Flexibility**: The threshold can be adjusted dynamically without regenerating keys
3. **Protocol Simplicity**: LSS uses straightforward polynomial secret sharing without complex MPC protocols
4. **Foundation for Higher Protocols**: LSS serves as a building block for more complex threshold schemes

These properties make LSS ideal for:
- Validator rotation in blockchain networks
- Long-lived custody solutions where signers change
- Disaster recovery scenarios requiring participant replacement
- Gradual migration between signer sets

## Technical Specification

### Core Concepts

LSS is based on Shamir's Secret Sharing using polynomial interpolation over a finite field. The key innovation is the resharing protocol that enables dynamic reconfiguration.

#### Mathematical Foundation

Given a secret `s` and threshold `t`:
1. Construct a random polynomial `f(x)` of degree `t-1` where `f(0) = s`
2. Each party `i` receives share `f(i)`
3. Any `t` parties can reconstruct `s` using Lagrange interpolation
4. The public key `Y = s·G` remains constant across resharing

#### Key Properties

- **Information Theoretic Security**: No computational assumptions required for secrecy
- **Perfect Secrecy**: Fewer than `t` shares reveal nothing about the secret
- **Homomorphic**: Operations on shares correspond to operations on secrets
- **Verifiable**: Using Feldman VSS, shares can be verified without revealing the secret

### Protocol Phases

#### 1. Distributed Key Generation (DKG)

LSS implements fully distributed key generation without any trusted dealer:

```
Input: Parties P = {p₁, ..., pₙ}, threshold t
Output: Share sᵢ for each party, public key Y

Round 1 - Polynomial Generation & Commitment:
Each party pᵢ:
1. Generate random secret sᵢ and polynomial fᵢ(x) of degree t-1 where fᵢ(0) = sᵢ
2. Compute commitments Cᵢⱼ = fᵢ(j)·G for each party j
3. Generate chain key for session binding
4. Broadcast commitments to all parties

Round 2 - Share Distribution:
Each party pᵢ:
1. Verify received commitments from all parties
2. Compute shares sᵢⱼ = fᵢ(j) for each party j
3. Send encrypted share sᵢⱼ to party pⱼ

Round 3 - Share Aggregation & Verification:
Each party pᵢ:
1. Verify received shares: sⱼᵢ·G ?= Cⱼᵢ
2. Compute final share: xᵢ = Σⱼ sⱼᵢ
3. Compute public key: Y = Σⱼ Cⱼ₀
4. Store configuration with share xᵢ and public key Y

Output: Distributed key with no single party knowing the secret
```

This DKG protocol ensures:
- **No Trusted Dealer**: Secret is generated collectively
- **Verifiability**: All shares can be verified using commitments
- **Robustness**: Protocol completes despite t-1 malicious parties

#### 2. Signing

```
Input: Message m, signers S ⊆ P with |S| ≥ t
Output: Schnorr signature (R, z)

1. Nonce Generation:
   Each signer i ∈ S:
   a. Generate random kᵢ
   b. Compute Rᵢ = kᵢ·G
   c. Broadcast Rᵢ

2. Aggregation:
   a. R = Σᵢ∈S λᵢ·Rᵢ (λᵢ are Lagrange coefficients)
   b. c = H(R, Y, m)

3. Response:
   Each signer i:
   a. Compute zᵢ = kᵢ + c·λᵢ·sᵢ
   b. Broadcast zᵢ

4. Combine:
   z = Σᵢ∈S zᵢ

5. Output: (R, z)
```

#### 3. Dynamic Resharing (Unique to LSS)

```
Input: Old parties P_old, new parties P_new, new threshold t_new
Output: New shares for P_new, same public key Y

1. Share Distribution:
   Each party pᵢ ∈ P_old:
   a. Create polynomial fᵢ(x) where fᵢ(0) = sᵢ_old
   b. Compute shares sᵢⱼ = fᵢ(j) for each pⱼ ∈ P_new
   c. Send sᵢⱼ to pⱼ with commitments

2. Share Aggregation:
   Each party pⱼ ∈ P_new:
   a. Collect shares from t_old parties in P_old
   b. Verify shares using commitments
   c. Compute new share sⱼ_new = Σᵢ sᵢⱼ

3. Verification:
   a. Verify public key unchanged: Y_new = Y_old
   b. Run verification protocol among P_new

4. Output: New shares {sⱼ_new} for P_new
```

### Security Model

#### Assumptions

1. **Honest Majority**: At most `t-1` corrupted parties
2. **Synchronous Network**: Messages delivered within known time bounds
3. **Secure Channels**: Authenticated encryption between parties
4. **Random Oracle**: Hash functions modeled as random oracles

#### Security Properties

1. **Unforgeability**: Adversary cannot forge signatures without `t` shares
2. **Robustness**: Protocol completes despite `t-1` malicious parties
3. **Privacy**: Share distribution reveals nothing about the secret
4. **Forward Security**: Past signatures remain secure after resharing

#### Threat Mitigation

- **Share Leakage**: Regular resharing invalidates old shares
- **Adaptive Corruption**: Proactive refresh limits corruption window
- **Network Attacks**: Authenticated channels prevent MITM
- **Replay Attacks**: Generation counter prevents share reuse

## Integration with Lux Network

### Use Cases

1. **Validator Rotation**: Seamless rotation of consensus validators
2. **Bridge Custody**: Dynamic bridge operator management
3. **DAO Treasury**: Evolving multisig with changing members
4. **Recovery Protocols**: Replace lost/compromised shares

### Compatibility

LSS integrates with existing Lux infrastructure:
- Compatible with M-Chain for MPC operations
- Works alongside CGG21 for ECDSA when needed
- Supports same key management infrastructure
- Uses common networking and storage layers

### Migration Path

For systems currently using static threshold schemes:
1. Generate LSS shares for existing key
2. Run parallel signing during transition
3. Gradually rotate out old system
4. Enable dynamic features once stable

## Test Coverage and Validation

- Network failures and recovery

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Asynchronous Resharing**: Support for asynchronous networks
2. **Weighted Shares**: Different parties hold different share weights
3. **Hierarchical Sharing**: Multi-level threshold structures
4. **Cross-Protocol Migration**: Convert between LSS and other schemes

### Research Directions

## Conclusion

LSS provides unique dynamic resharing capabilities essential for long-lived threshold systems.
