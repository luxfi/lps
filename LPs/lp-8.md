## Abstract

This LP describes a Plugin Architecture for Lux nodes (for the lpm repo, possibly Lux Plugin Manager). This LP sets the standard for extending Lux node functionality via plugins or modules, without needing to fork or alter core code.

## Specification

*(This LP will specify how plugins are structured, how they are installed/loaded by a node, and what APIs they can access.)*

## Rationale

This standard encourages a rich ecosystem of node add-ons (think monitoring dashboards, alternative mempool analyzers, etc.) that can be developed independently.

## Copyright

Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](../LICENSE.md).
## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is additive; existing behavior remains unchanged. Migration can be performed progressively.

## Security Considerations

Implement input checks, authentication as needed, and standard defenses against replay/DoS.

## Motivation

Standardizing this area improves developer experience and interoperability across wallets, tooling, and chains within Lux.
