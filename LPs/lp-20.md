LRC-20 is analogous to Ethereum’s well-known ERC-20 fungible token standard. It defines the interface and behavior for fungible tokens on Lux’s platform.

## Motivation

A common fungible token interface enables wallet, exchange, and tooling interoperability, simplifies audits, and reduces fragmentation across Lux smart contracts and dApps.

## Specification

```solidity
interface ILRC20 {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}
```

## Rationale

The design prioritizes clarity, interoperability, and operational simplicity, selecting mechanisms that reduce ambiguity and ease integration across Lux tooling and chains.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is additive. Existing components remain functional; migration can occur incrementally without breaking changes.

## Security Considerations

Follow least‑privilege, validate inputs, and apply cryptographic best practices where applicable to avoid misuse and ambiguity.
