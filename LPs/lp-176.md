# LP-176: Dynamic EVM Gas Limit and Price Discovery Updates

## Status
**Implemented** - Added to node in commit 78bbdee

## Abstract
This proposal implements dynamic gas limit and price discovery mechanisms for the EVM to improve network efficiency and fee predictability.

## Motivation
The current static gas limits and fee mechanisms can lead to:
- Network congestion during peak usage
- Unpredictable transaction costs
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Poor user experience during high-demand periods

## Specification

### Dynamic Gas Limits
The implementation provides adaptive gas limits based on:
- Network utilization metrics
- Block fill rates
- Transaction queue depth
- Historical demand patterns

### Price Discovery
Implements improved fee estimation through:
- Real-time demand analysis
- Predictive modeling for fee trends
- Market-based pricing mechanisms
- Priority fee optimization

### Implementation Details
Located in: `vms/evm/lp176/`

Key components:
- `State`: Manages dynamic fee state
- `Reader`: Provides fee calculation interfaces
- Gas target and capacity management
- Excess gas tracking for EIP-1559 compatibility

## Backwards Compatibility
Fully backwards compatible with existing EVM transactions while providing enhanced fee mechanisms for new transactions.

## Security Considerations
- Prevents fee manipulation attacks
- Ensures deterministic fee calculations
- Maintains consensus on fee state across validators

## Test Cases
Comprehensive test suite in `vms/evm/lp176/lp176_test.go` covering:
- Dynamic target calculations
- Fee estimation accuracy
- State transitions
- Edge cases and bounds checking

## Implementation
- **Node**: github.com/luxfi/node v1.17.1+
- **Consensus**: Integrated with Lux consensus v1.18.1
- **Activation**: Post-Etna upgrade
