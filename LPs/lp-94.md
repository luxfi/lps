## Abstract

This research LP explores governance frameworks for the Lux Network, analyzing different decentralized governance models, voting mechanisms, proposal systems, and treasury management. It examines how Lux's multi-chain architecture enables innovative governance approaches and provides recommendations for building an effective, inclusive governance system.

## Motivation

Effective governance is essential for:

1. **Decentralization**: Distribute decision-making power
2. **Evolution**: Adapt to changing market conditions
3. **Treasury Management**: Allocate resources effectively
4. **Community Alignment**: Ensure stakeholder representation
5. **Protocol Upgrades**: Coordinate network improvements

## Current Implementation

### Governance Components in Ecosystem
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/luxdefi/governance
- **Status**: Research phase
- **Model**: Token-weighted with delegation

### Existing Governance Touchpoints
```typescript
// Current governance elements across repos
interface GovernanceArchitecture {
  voting: {
    repo: "luxdefi/governance";
    mechanism: "Token-weighted voting";
    delegation: true;
    timelock: "48 hours";
  };
  
  treasury: {
    repo: "luxdefi/treasury";
    multisig: "5 of 9";
    funds: ["Development", "Ecosystem", "Community"];
  };
  
  proposals: {
    types: ["Protocol", "Treasury", "Parameter"];
    threshold: "100,000 LUX";
    quorum: "10% of supply";
  };
}
```

## Research Findings

### 1. Voting Mechanisms

#### Quadratic Voting Implementation
```solidity
// Quadratic voting to reduce whale influence
contract QuadraticGovernance {
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 id;
        string description;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 endTime;
        uint256 totalVotes;
        mapping(address => uint256) voterCredits;
        mapping(uint256 => uint256) optionVotes;
        bool executed;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(address => uint256) public votingPower;
    
    function vote(
        uint256 proposalId,
        uint256 option,
        uint256 credits
    ) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp >= proposal.startTime, "Not started");
        require(block.timestamp < proposal.endTime, "Ended");
        
        uint256 currentCredits = proposal.voterCredits[msg.sender];
        uint256 totalCredits = currentCredits + credits;
        
        // Quadratic cost: votes = sqrt(credits)
        uint256 currentVotes = sqrt(currentCredits);
        uint256 newVotes = sqrt(totalCredits);
        uint256 additionalVotes = newVotes - currentVotes;
        
        // Check user has enough voting power
        require(
            votingPower[msg.sender] >= totalCredits,
            "Insufficient voting power"
        );
        
        proposal.voterCredits[msg.sender] = totalCredits;
        proposal.optionVotes[option] += additionalVotes;
        proposal.totalVotes += additionalVotes;
        
        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, option, additionalVotes);
    }
    
    function sqrt(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        uint256 z = (x + 1) / 2;
        uint256 y = x;
        while (z < y) {
            y = z;
            z = (x / z + z) / 2;
        }
        return y;
    }
}
```

### 2. Multi-Chain Governance

#### Cross-Chain Coordination
```solidity
// Governance across Lux's eight chains
contract MultiChainGovernance {
    struct ChainWeight {
        uint256 chainId;
        uint256 weight;     // Voting weight multiplier
        address governor;   // Chain-specific governor
    }
    
    struct CrossChainProposal {
        bytes32 proposalHash;
        uint256[] targetChains;
        bytes[] calldata;
        uint256 totalVotes;
        mapping(uint256 => uint256) chainVotes;
        mapping(uint256 => bool) chainExecuted;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => ChainWeight) public chainWeights;
    mapping(bytes32 => CrossChainProposal) public proposals;
    
    // Different chains have different voting weights
    constructor() {
        chainWeights[1] = ChainWeight(1, 30, address(0)); // C-Chain: 30%
        chainWeights[2] = ChainWeight(2, 25, address(0)); // X-Chain: 25%
        chainWeights[3] = ChainWeight(3, 20, address(0)); // P-Chain: 20%
        chainWeights[4] = ChainWeight(4, 15, address(0)); // M-Chain: 15%
        chainWeights[5] = ChainWeight(5, 10, address(0)); // Z-Chain: 10%
    }
    
    function aggregateVotes(bytes32 proposalHash) external view returns (uint256) {
        CrossChainProposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalHash];
        uint256 weightedVotes = 0;
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < proposal.targetChains.length; i++) {
            uint256 chainId = proposal.targetChains[i];
            uint256 chainVote = proposal.chainVotes[chainId];
            uint256 weight = chainWeights[chainId].weight;
            
            weightedVotes += (chainVote * weight) / 100;
        }
        
        return weightedVotes;
    }
}
```

### 3. Delegation Systems

#### Liquid Democracy
```solidity
// Delegation with recursive vote counting
contract LiquidDemocracy {
    struct Delegation {
        address delegate;
        uint256 timestamp;
        bool isActive;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Delegation) public delegations;
    mapping(address => uint256) public votingPower;
    mapping(address => address[]) public delegators;
    
    function delegate(address to) external {
        require(to != msg.sender, "Cannot delegate to self");
        require(to != address(0), "Invalid delegate");
        
        // Check for circular delegation
        address current = to;
        while (delegations[current].isActive) {
            current = delegations[current].delegate;
            require(current != msg.sender, "Circular delegation");
        }
        
        // Remove from previous delegate
        if (delegations[msg.sender].isActive) {
            _removeDelegator(
                delegations[msg.sender].delegate,
                msg.sender
            );
        }
        
        // Add to new delegate
        delegations[msg.sender] = Delegation({
            delegate: to,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            isActive: true
        });
        
        delegators[to].push(msg.sender);
        
        emit DelegationChanged(msg.sender, to);
    }
    
    function getVotingPower(address voter) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 power = votingPower[voter];
        
        // Add delegated power recursively
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < delegators[voter].length; i++) {
            address delegator = delegators[voter][i];
            if (delegations[delegator].isActive) {
                power += getVotingPower(delegator);
            }
        }
        
        return power;
    }
}
```

### 4. Treasury Management

#### Programmable Treasury
```solidity
// Advanced treasury with streaming and vesting
contract ProgrammableTreasury {
    struct Stream {
        address recipient;
        uint256 amountPerSecond;
        uint256 startTime;
        uint256 endTime;
        uint256 withdrawn;
        bool cancellable;
    }
    
    struct Grant {
        address recipient;
        uint256 totalAmount;
        uint256 vestingStart;
        uint256 vestingDuration;
        uint256 cliffDuration;
        uint256 withdrawn;
        bool revocable;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Stream) public streams;
    mapping(uint256 => Grant) public grants;
    uint256 public nextStreamId;
    uint256 public nextGrantId;
    
    modifier onlyGovernance() {
        require(msg.sender == governance, "Not governance");
        _;
    }
    
    function createStream(
        address recipient,
        uint256 totalAmount,
        uint256 duration
    ) external onlyGovernance returns (uint256 streamId) {
        streamId = nextStreamId++;
        
        streams[streamId] = Stream({
            recipient: recipient,
            amountPerSecond: totalAmount / duration,
            startTime: block.timestamp,
            endTime: block.timestamp + duration,
            withdrawn: 0,
            cancellable: true
        });
        
        emit StreamCreated(streamId, recipient, totalAmount, duration);
    }
    
    function withdrawFromStream(uint256 streamId) external {
        Stream storage stream = streams[streamId];
        require(msg.sender == stream.recipient, "Not recipient");
        
        uint256 available = _getAvailableAmount(stream);
        require(available > 0, "Nothing to withdraw");
        
        stream.withdrawn += available;
        
        // Transfer tokens
        token.transfer(stream.recipient, available);
        
        emit StreamWithdrawal(streamId, available);
    }
    
    function _getAvailableAmount(Stream memory stream) 
        private 
        view 
        returns (uint256) 
    {
        if (block.timestamp < stream.startTime) return 0;
        
        uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp >= stream.endTime
            ? stream.endTime - stream.startTime
            : block.timestamp - stream.startTime;
            
        uint256 totalVested = elapsed * stream.amountPerSecond;
        return totalVested - stream.withdrawn;
    }
}
```

### 5. Proposal Lifecycle

```typescript
// Comprehensive proposal system
interface ProposalLifecycle {
  stages: {
    idea: {
      location: "Forum discussion";
      duration: "Open-ended";
      requirements: "None";
    };
    
    draft: {
      location: "GitHub PR";
      duration: "7 days minimum";
      requirements: ["100K LUX support", "Technical specification"];
    };
    
    review: {
      location: "On-chain proposal";
      duration: "3 days";
      requirements: ["Security audit if code", "Economic analysis"];
    };
    
    voting: {
      location: "Multi-chain governance";
      duration: "7 days";
      requirements: ["10% quorum", "60% approval"];
    };
    
    timelock: {
      location: "Timelock contract";
      duration: "48 hours";
      requirements: ["No veto from security council"];
    };
    
    execution: {
      location: "Target chain";
      duration: "Immediate";
      requirements: ["Automated execution"];
    };
  };
}
```
