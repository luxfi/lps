## Abstract

This LP specifies the Lux Network Runner and testing frameworks (for the netrunner repo). This LP defines how to instantiate and manage local networks for testing and development.

## Specification

*(This LP will outline a standard interface (CLI commands, config files, APIs) to spin up a multi-chain Lux network on a developer’s machine or CI environment.)*

## Rationale

By formalizing this in a LP, contributors will know how to test protocol changes and new applications in a controlled environment, which improves the overall quality and reliability of Lux’s ecosystem.
