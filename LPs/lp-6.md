## Abstract

This LP specifies the Lux Network Runner and testing frameworks (for the netrunner repo). This LP defines how to instantiate and manage local networks for testing and development.

## Specification

*(This LP will outline a standard interface (CLI commands, config files, APIs) to spin up a multi-chain Lux network on a developer’s machine or CI environment.)*

## Rationale

By formalizing this in a LP, contributors will know how to test protocol changes and new applications in a controlled environment, which improves the overall quality and reliability of Lux’s ecosystem.

## Motivation

A standard network runner removes ad‑hoc scripts and inconsistencies, enabling reliable local/CI testing, reproducible environments, and faster iteration for protocol and dApp developers.

## Copyright

Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](../LICENSE.md).
## Backwards Compatibility

Additive specification; no breaking changes to existing interfaces. Adoption is optional per component.

## Security Considerations

Follow threat models relevant to this LP (input validation, replay/DoS protections, key handling). Implement recommended mitigations.
