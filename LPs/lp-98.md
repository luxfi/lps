## Abstract

The Lux Network requires a unified graph database and GraphQL query engine natively integrated as G-Chain, providing indexing across all 8 chains (A, B, C, G, M, Q, X, Z). This LP defines a modular Go-based solution consisting of:
- a high-performance, deterministic graph storage engine (lux/graphdb) built on BadgerDB with quantum-safe signatures;
- a custom GraphVM interpreter (lux/graphql) that compiles GraphQL queries with gas metering;
- decentralized G-Chain nodes that users can run for local scaling and custom indexing; and
- quantum-safe query authentication using dual certificates (BLS + Ringtail).

By implementing GraphQL as a dedicated chain (G-Chain) with BadgerDB storage, Lux enables rich, performant queries with horizontal scaling—users can run their own nodes for read performance, custom indexing strategies, and specialized use cases.

## Motivation

Blockchain dApps and infrastructure need fast, expressive access to cross-chain state (assets, addresses, validators, transactions, subnets, etc.). External indexers introduce trust assumptions, latency, and version skew. On-chain contracts cannot efficiently traverse large graphs in Solidity. This LP solves both problems by:

1. Providing a deterministic, high-performance BadgerDB backend that scales to chain-wide data.
2. Exposing a GraphQL interface for rich queries with quantum-safe authentication.
3. Enabling horizontal scaling through user-operated G-Chain nodes for:
   - **Read Performance**: Local caching and query optimization
   - **Custom Indexing**: Application-specific data structures
   - **Privacy**: Query without exposing patterns to public nodes
   - **Specialization**: Domain-specific aggregations and analytics

This decentralized approach ensures:
- Every node maintains consistent graph state via BadgerDB
- Users control their query infrastructure and can scale independently
- Quantum-safe signatures protect query integrity
- Applications can optimize for their specific access patterns

## Specification

### 1. GraphDB Backend (lux/graphdb)

- **BadgerDB Foundation**: Uses BadgerDB as the core storage engine, shared across all Lux chains for consistency
- **Quantum-Safe Storage**: All data entries signed with dual certificates (BLS + Ringtail) for future-proof security
- **Deterministic State**: Synchronized compaction and SSTable generation keeps all G-Chain nodes in consensus
- **Optimized Key-Value Model**: 
  - Nodes: `Node:<chain>:<type>:<id>`
  - Edges: `Edge:<chain>:<src_type>:<src_id>:<relation>:<dst_type>:<dst_id>`
  - Cross-chain refs: `XRef:<src_chain>:<dst_chain>:<id>`
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Users run local G-Chain nodes with selective sync:
  - Full sync: Complete network state
  - Chain sync: Specific chains only (e.g., just C-Chain + X-Chain)
  - App sync: Application-specific subgraphs
- **Custom Indexing**: Nodes can maintain additional indexes for specialized queries

### 2. GraphVM Interpreter (luxfi/graphql)

- **Bytecode Compilation**: Parses incoming GraphQL queries into a Solidity‑compatible bytecode instruction set, enabling on-chain execution paths.
- **Gas‑Metered Execution**: Executes query bytecode with fine‑grained gas costs per opcode (e.g. edge iteration, filters, aggregations) to enforce EVM block gas limits.
- **Solidity‑Compatible ABI**: Defines query bytecode and data structures (256‑bit words, bytes arrays) so that contracts can store and invoke pre-compiled queries as calls to precompiles.
- **Query Semantics**: Supports GraphQL read queries natively and optional write mutations via separate instructions; result sets are serialized to JSON (for off‑chain) or packed for contract return values.

### 3. EVM Precompiles (luxfi/precompiles at 0x0B–0x11)

- **Mutation Precompiles (0x0B–0x10)**: On-chain transactions can call precompiles to add/update graph nodes and edges, atomically updating Badger-Plus and the Verkle trie within block processing. Gas costs reflect data size and complexity.
- **Proof Verifier Precompile (0x11)**: Verifies Merkle/Verkle/light-client proofs for cross-chain data before graph ingestion, mirroring Lux Warp Messaging patterns. Valid proofs trigger corresponding graph mutations.

### 4. Node Integration

- **C‑Chain Hooks**: Registers graph precompiles via LuxGo config; precompiles have read‑write access to the GraphDB instance.
- **P‑Chain and X‑Chain Hooks**: Implements deterministic block event listeners that update the graph (e.g. new subnets, UTXO events) by calling graphdb APIs directly during block processing.
- **State Commitments**: Maintains a Verkle trie commitment to the graph state; the current root is published in block metadata to enable succinct on‑chain proofs and light‑client verification.

## Rationale

Splitting responsibilities into graphdb, graphql, and precompiles isolates concerns, simplifies testing, and enables independent evolution (e.g. alternate backends or query engines). Badger-Plus tuning ensures high write/read performance and deterministic state across nodes. A standalone GraphVM with Solidity‑aligned bytecode makes on-chain graph queries feasible, avoiding the prohibitive gas costs of pure EVM loops. Precompiles integrate graph operations seamlessly into consensus, maintaining atomicity and determinism.

## Decentralized Node Architecture

G-Chain's design enables users to run their own nodes for various use cases:

### Performance Scaling
- **Local Caching**: Keep frequently accessed data in memory
- **Query Optimization**: Pre-compute complex aggregations
- **Geographic Distribution**: Deploy nodes near users for low latency
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute queries across multiple nodes

### Custom Use Cases
- **DeFi Protocols**: Index specific pools, positions, and price history
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Track ownership, metadata, and trading patterns
- **Gaming**: Index player stats, achievements, and game state
- **Analytics**: Build specialized dashboards and reporting tools

### Privacy Benefits
- **Query Privacy**: Don't expose query patterns to public nodes
- **Data Filtering**: Index only relevant data for your application
- **Access Control**: Implement custom authentication layers
- **Compliance**: Filter data based on regulatory requirements

### Integration Patterns
```graphql
# Example: DeFi protocol querying across chains
query CrossChainPortfolio($address: Address!) {
  cchain: positions(chain: "C", owner: $address) {
    protocol, asset, amount, value
  }
  xchain: orders(chain: "X", trader: $address) {
    pair, side, price, status
  }
  achain: compute(chain: "A", provider: $address) {
    jobs, earnings, reputation
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP adds new precompiles (0x0B–0x11) and node hooks; it does not break existing APIs or state. Nodes without this LP will ignore graph calls, and contracts cannot invoke unknown precompiles, resulting in fallback behaviors. Clients should upgrade before relying on graph features.

## Test Cases

- Unit tests for Badger-Plus determinism, batch ingestion, and Verkle trie updates in luxfi/graphdb.
- GraphVM opcode tests with gas accounting and expected results in luxfi/graphql.
- Precompile integration tests simulating EVM calls to 0x0B–0x11, state changes, and proof verification.
- End‑to‑end tests: JSON‑RPC/GraphQL query responses and contract calls to precompiles on a testnet.

## Reference Implementation

Reference code is available in three Go modules:

- https://github.com/luxfi/graphql
- https://github.com/luxfi/precompiles

## Security Considerations

Graph data exposes rich on-chain relationships; access controls and gas metering prevent DoS via expensive queries. Proof verification requires accurate light-client state; nodes must keep proof roots synchronized. Deterministic storage tuning avoids fork divergence. Any cryptographic commitment scheme (Merkle, Verkle) must undergo independent audit.

## Economic Impact

GraphVM query gas costs and precompile storage writes introduce new gas sinks; these must be calibrated to balance usability and anti‑spam. Bulk ingestion occurs off‑chain at node startup (no on-chain fees). Incentives for data integrity rely on validator uptime and node operators maintaining graph commitments.

## Open Questions

- Should mutation precompiles support batch inserts within a single call?
- What guardrails (whitelists, ACLs) are needed for schema evolution or custom GraphQL extensions?
- How to best surface proof root updates to light clients (block metadata vs. separate registry)?
