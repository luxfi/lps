## Abstract

Defines interfaces and guidance for Lux wallet interoperability across chains and dApps.

## Motivation

Consistent wallet behavior and interfaces reduce integration friction, improve UX, and enhance security across the ecosystem.
## Specification

This LP’s normative content is the set of algorithms, data models, and parameters described herein. Implementations MUST follow those details for interoperability.

## Rationale

Design choices favor simplicity and reliability while meeting Lux performance and ecosystem requirements.

## Backwards Compatibility

Additive change; existing APIs and formats remain valid. Adoption is opt‑in.

## Security Considerations

Consider typical threat models (input validation, replay/DoS resistance, key handling). Apply recommended safeguards outlined in the text.
