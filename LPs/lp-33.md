## Abstract

This LP specifies how to roll up validator-set and subnet-state roots from the P-Chain onto the C-Chain (EVM) via on-chain commitments and light-client-style proofs. By anchoring P-Chain state in EVM contracts, smart contracts on the C-Chain can verify proofs of P-Chain state (e.g., validator sets, staking balances, subnet activations) without running a full P-Chain node.

## Motivation

The P-Chain (Platform Chain) manages validator sets, subnets, and staking, while the C-Chain (Contract Chain) provides EVM execution. Many L2 rollups, DeFi protocols, and governance modules require trust-minimized access to P-Chain state (e.g., validator eligibility, slashing events). Embedding P-Chain state roots and proof verification on the C-Chain:

- Enables EVM contracts to enforce P-Chain-based access control and consensus logic
- Eliminates the need for centralized or off-chain oracles for validator/subnet data
- Simplifies integration of rollup sequencers that must respect P-Chain staking rules

## Specification

### 1. On-Chain Commitment Contract

Deploy a Solidity contract `PChainAnchor` on the C-Chain with functions:
```solidity
contract PChainAnchor {
    // Emitted when a new P-Chain state root is committed
    event StateRootCommitted(uint256 indexed height, bytes32 stateRoot, bytes validatorSetHash);

    // Commit a new P-Chain state root (only callable by authorized relayer)
    function commitStateRoot(uint256 height, bytes32 stateRoot, bytes calldata validatorSetHash) external;

    // Verify a Merkle proof against the committed root at 'height'
    function verifyProof(
        uint256 height,
        bytes32 leaf,
        bytes32[] calldata proof,
        bytes32[] calldata path
    ) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### 2. Off-Chain Relayer

A permissioned relayer service (e.g. sequencer or validator node) periodically:

1. Fetches the P-Chain state root and validator-set root at completed height H
2. Hashes the validator-set data into `validatorSetHash`
3. Submits a `commitStateRoot(H, stateRoot, validatorSetHash)` transaction

The relayer should only commit roots after finality (e.g., sufficiently many Lux consensus confirmations).

### 3. Proof Verification in EVM

Smart contracts import `PChainAnchor` and call `verifyProof` to:

- Check that a P-Chain staking balance or subnet activation is valid
- Ensure a validator’s signature or slashing event occurred

Proofs follow a standard Merkle Patricia inclusion proof format, using precompiled SHA3 and RLP decoding when needed.

## Rationale

Anchoring P-Chain state in EVM mirrors Ethereum’s [Beacon Chain state proofs EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-?). By leveraging the P-Chain consensus security and the C-Chain execution environment, we avoid bridging wrapped tokens or trusting off-chain oracles, achieving full decentralization.

## Backwards Compatibility

This LP is additive; existing C-Chain and P-Chain operations remain unaffected. Contracts not using the anchor will function as before.

## Test Cases

1. **Commit & Verify**: Commit a known P-Chain state root and verify true proof inclusion/exclusion.
2. **Invalid Proofs**: Ensure proofs against non-committed height or wrong leaf/path revert.
3. **Access Control**: Test that only authorized relayers can call `commitStateRoot`.

## Reference Implementation

See the `/standard/rollups/pchain-anchor` directory for a reference Solidity implementation and JavaScript test suite.

## Security Considerations

- **Relayer trust**: Use multisig or threshold signatures for relayer commits to avoid single-point-of-failure.
- **Proof validity**: Enforce strict gas limits to prevent DoS with excessively large proofs.
- **Fork handling**: Commit only after P-Chain fork finality to avoid reorg-induced double commits.

## Economic Impact (optional)

Relayer operators pay L1 gas to submit state anchors. At ~50 gwei and ~100 000 gas per commit, each anchor costs ~$9. Operators can recoup fees via a small on-chain fee charged to downstream users per proof verification.

## Open Questions (optional)

1. Should commits be batched over multiple heights to reduce per-anchor gas?  
2. How to integrate Z-Chain state proofs for privacy-preserving applications?  
3. What finality window on P-Chain ensures safety vs. liveness trade-offs?
