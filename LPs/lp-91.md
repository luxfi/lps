## Abstract

This research LP analyzes payment processing architectures for the Lux Network, focusing on fiat on-ramps, credit card integration, recurring payments, and the zero-interest credit system. It examines the current implementations in the Lux Pay and Credit repositories and provides recommendations for building compliant, user-friendly payment infrastructure.

## Motivation

Bridging traditional finance with blockchain requires sophisticated payment processing that addresses:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: KYC/AML requirements across jurisdictions
2. **User Experience**: Credit card-like simplicity for crypto payments
3. **Merchant Adoption**: Easy integration for businesses
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Lower fees than traditional payment processors
5. **Privacy Balance**: Compliance without sacrificing user privacy

## Current Implementation

### Lux Pay Repository
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/luxdefi/pay
- **Status**: Production
- **Features**: Fiat on-ramp, merchant tools, subscription payments

### Lux Credit Repository  
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/luxdefi/credit
- **Status**: Beta
- **Innovation**: Zero-interest credit cards backed by crypto collateral

### Architecture Overview

```typescript
// Payment system architecture from repos
interface PaymentArchitecture {
  gateway: {
    providers: ["Stripe", "Circle", "Wyre"];
    supported_methods: ["Card", "Bank", "Crypto"];
    compliance: ["PCI-DSS", "SOC2"];
  };
  
  processing: {
    flow: "Gateway → Lux Pay → Smart Contract → Settlement";
    confirmation_time: "2-3 seconds";
    rollback_mechanism: "Escrow-based";
  };
  
  credit_system: {
    collateral_ratio: 150;  // 150% overcollateralized
    interest_rate: 0;       // Zero interest
    liquidation_threshold: 120;
    accepted_collateral: ["LUX", "BTC", "ETH", "Stablecoins"];
  };
}
```

## Research Findings

### 1. Fiat On-Ramp Architecture

#### Current Implementation
```typescript
// From pay repository
class FiatGateway {
  async processPayment(params: PaymentParams): Promise<PaymentResult> {
    // 1. KYC verification
    const kycResult = await this.verifyKYC(params.user);
    if (!kycResult.passed) throw new KYCError();
    
    // 2. Payment processing
    const charge = await this.provider.createCharge({
      amount: params.amount,
      currency: params.currency,
      payment_method: params.method,
      metadata: {
        userId: params.user.id,
        destinationAddress: params.cryptoAddress
      }
    });
    
    // 3. Crypto conversion
    const cryptoAmount = await this.convertToCrypto(
      charge.amount,
      charge.currency,
      params.targetCrypto
    );
    
    // 4. On-chain settlement
    const tx = await this.settleOnChain(
      params.cryptoAddress,
      cryptoAmount,
      params.targetCrypto
    );
    
    return { charge, tx, status: 'completed' };
  }
}
```

#### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Batched Settlements**: Reduce gas costs by batching multiple payments
2. **Stablecoin Rails**: Use USDC/USDT for faster settlement
3. **Regional Providers**: Local payment methods for better conversion rates

### 2. Zero-Interest Credit System

#### Innovative Model
```solidity
// From credit repository contracts
contract LuxCredit {
    struct CreditLine {
        address user;
        uint256 collateralAmount;
        address collateralAsset;
        uint256 creditLimit;
        uint256 usedCredit;
        uint256 lastPayment;
        uint8 healthFactor;
    }
    
    // No interest charged - revenue from:
    // 1. Merchant fees (1.5%)
    // 2. Collateral yield strategies
    // 3. Liquidation fees
    
    function borrowAgainstCollateral(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (uint256 creditLine) {
        require(amount >= minCollateral[asset], "Insufficient collateral");
        
        uint256 creditLimit = amount * collateralRatio[asset] / 100;
        
        creditLines[msg.sender] = CreditLine({
            user: msg.sender,
            collateralAmount: amount,
            collateralAsset: asset,
            creditLimit: creditLimit,
            usedCredit: 0,
            lastPayment: block.timestamp,
            healthFactor: 100
        });
        
        // Deploy collateral to yield strategies
        _deployToYield(asset, amount);
        
        emit CreditLineOpened(msg.sender, creditLimit);
    }
}
```

### 3. Recurring Payments

#### Subscription Model
```solidity
// Subscription payment implementation
contract RecurringPayments {
    struct Subscription {
        address merchant;
        address customer;
        uint256 amount;
        uint256 interval; // seconds
        uint256 nextPayment;
        bool active;
        address paymentToken;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => Subscription) public subscriptions;
    
    function authorizeSubscription(
        address merchant,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 interval,
        address token
    ) external returns (bytes32 subscriptionId) {
        subscriptionId = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(merchant, msg.sender, block.timestamp)
        );
        
        subscriptions[subscriptionId] = Subscription({
            merchant: merchant,
            customer: msg.sender,
            amount: amount,
            interval: interval,
            nextPayment: block.timestamp + interval,
            active: true,
            paymentToken: token
        });
        
        // First payment
        _processPayment(subscriptionId);
    }
    
    function processScheduledPayment(bytes32 subscriptionId) external {
        Subscription storage sub = subscriptions[subscriptionId];
        require(sub.active, "Inactive subscription");
        require(block.timestamp >= sub.nextPayment, "Too early");
        
        _processPayment(subscriptionId);
        sub.nextPayment += sub.interval;
    }
}
```

### 4. Merchant Integration

#### Point of Sale System
```typescript
// Merchant SDK from pay repository
class LuxMerchantSDK {
  constructor(private apiKey: string) {}
  
  async createPaymentRequest(params: {
    amount: number;
    currency: string;
    description: string;
  }): Promise<PaymentRequest> {
    const request = await this.api.post('/payment-requests', {
      ...params,
      webhook: this.webhookUrl,
      acceptedTokens: ['LUX', 'USDC', 'USDT'],
      network: 'lux-c-chain'
    });
    
    return {
      id: request.id,
      qrCode: request.qrCode,
      deepLink: request.deepLink,
      expiresAt: request.expiresAt
    };
  }
  
  async verifyPayment(paymentId: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const payment = await this.api.get(`/payments/${paymentId}`);
    
    // Verify on-chain
    const onChainTx = await this.verifyOnChain(
      payment.txHash,
      payment.network
    );
    
    return payment.status === 'completed' && onChainTx.confirmed;
  }
}
```

### 5. Compliance Framework

#### KYC/AML Integration
```typescript
// Compliance module architecture
interface ComplianceSystem {
  providers: {
    kyc: ["Jumio", "Onfido", "Sumsub"];
    aml: ["Chainalysis", "Elliptic", "TRM Labs"];
    sanctions: ["OFAC", "UN", "EU"];
  };
  
  flow: {
    onboarding: ["Email verification", "Identity check", "Address proof"];
    transaction_monitoring: ["Real-time screening", "Risk scoring", "Reporting"];
    reporting: ["STR/SAR filing", "Regulatory reporting", "Audit trails"];
  };
  
  privacy_preservation: {
    data_minimization: true;
    encryption: "AES-256";
    storage: "Segregated by jurisdiction";
    retention: "As per regulatory requirements";
  };
}
```
